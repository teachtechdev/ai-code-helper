# AI Code Helper

AI Code Helper is an open-source tool designed to help learners understand programming by generating natural language explanations of code snippets using LLMs (e.g. OpenAI GPT).

## Why It Matters

Many beginners struggle to understand what code is doing. This tool allows users to paste any block of code and receive a clear explanation â€” like a tutor sitting next to you.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Flask (API)
- OpenAI API
- HTML (frontend placeholder)

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/teachtechdev/ai-code-helper.git
cd ai-code-helper
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Then open your browser at `http://localhost:5000`.
